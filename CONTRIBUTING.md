# Welcome to the Contributing Guide

First off, thank you for considering contributing to the **Universal React Native SQLite MCP**! 

Whether you're fixing a typo, optimizing an ADB command, or pointing out a glaring architecture flaw, your help is what makes open source awesome. I built this tool to fill a massive gap in the current MCP ecosystem around mobile development. There are plenty of SQLite tools out there, but none that seamlessly hook into your local emulators and simulators. And all the MCP's around mobile development are primarily UI focused. So hopefully this fills a niche. Let's make mobile dev less painful together!

## The Vibe

- **Keep it chill, but keep it working**: Have fun with the code and the docs, but let's make sure the core functionality is rock solid.
- **Assume good intent**: We're all here to build cool stuff and learn. Be kind in your PRs and specific in your code reviews.
- **Developer Experience (DX) is king**: This tool exists to make life easier. If a feature makes the tool harder to use or setup, we probably need to rethink it.

## 🛠️ How to get started

1. **Fork the repo** and clone it locally.
2. **Install dependencies**: `npm install`
3. **Make your changes**: Branch off `main` and do your thing.
4. **Test it out locally**: Build it with `npm run build` and point your local MCP client to it to verify it actually works against an emulator/simulator.
5. **Open a PR**: Give it a descriptive title and tell me what you fixed or added.

## Found a Bug?

Please open an issue! Tell me:
- What you were trying to do.
- What actually happened.
- Are you on iOS, Android, or both? 
- Any logs you have from your AI client.

## Got a Feature Idea?

Open an issue and let's chat about it before you spend hours coding it up. I'm totally open to new ideas (especially if they involve making the auto-discovery even smarter).

Let's build something epic together.
